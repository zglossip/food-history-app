# Food History (Mobile)

Version 0.1.0

A mobile application for tracking cooking history, recipes, and sources.

Currently a work in progress.

## Backend

This application requires a REST API. The repository containing the API application can be found [here](https://github.com/zglossip/food-history-api)

It also requires an `.env` file containing a `VITE_BACKEND_BASE` property. This property should be the URL to the backend.

For local dev without the backend, run the mock API with `npm run mock:api` (json-server) and keep `VITE_BACKEND_BASE=http://localhost:3001` (see `.env.development`).
